	If you understand the simple method of RunAsAdmin,<br> 
	it is easy to use this tool effective for various purposes <br>
	on a single workstation up to a big domain forest.
	</p>

	<p>
	RunAsAdmin.exe is a grafical interface to install the service of RunAsRob and set the allowed directories into the registry path of RunAsRob.<br>
	If a limited user start an application by a shortcut, created from RunAsAdmin, or the user drag an drop the application over RunasRob.exe,<br>
	the service of RunAsRob compare its registry setting, if this is an allowed application.<br>
	If it is allowed, the service of RunAsRob start it with system account or as administrator, according the logon option you set in the RunAsAdmin interface.<br>
	Default read only permissions on microsoft systems, avoid that a limited user manipulate registry settings or files in the default program location.<br>
	In collaboration with directory permissions, OUs or Group Policies, RunAsAdmin can be a versatile tool in a big domain. <br>

	<a id="WithNTFSReadpersmissions"></a>By read rights on share and folder permissions you can authorize specific users or computers in a domain, <br>
	which can use the allowed directory in RunAsAdmin for RunAsRob.exe.
	</H3>
	
	<p>
	In screenshot below, i share three central folders software, updates, taxlaw on a network server<br>
	and i set appropriate read rights for the specific group &gt;Region admins&lt;, &gt;Users&lt;, and &gt;Accountants&lt;,<br>
	and all computer clients in domain by group &gt;Domain Computers&lt;.<br>
	On share taxlaw i resctrict the allowed call to computer group &gt; Accountants Computers&lt;. <br>
	Finally i authorize on clients this network directories in RunAsAdmin.<br>
	Now users of the specific group can run applications from their appropriate folder via RunAsRob with system or administrator account.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Please note following network rules for the understanding<br>
	- the local system account is the Active Directory computer object in the domain with the name of the machine.<br>
	- that a network share permission of a folder and a permission from a folder are completely separate from each other. You should always configure both access permissions on your shared folder.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Network share permissions on Server, in this screenshot as example of the folder taxlaw <br>

	</p>

	<p>
	Finally, authorize network share on client computer in RunAsAdmin<br>

	<p>
	Here you see the registry values of RunAsRob with AllowedPath and LogonFlag, which will be set by RunAsAdmin and checked from RunAsRob, if an application should start via RunAsRob.<br>
	You can also edit them by policy or manually.<br>

	You can download this RunAsRob Group Policy admx und adml files on <a href="https://robotronic.de/runasrob/RunAsRobPolicy.zip">RunAsRobPolicy.zip</a><br>
	On Screenshot you see an OU Finance, i assign the PolicyRunAsRob and add the allowed directories &gt;&gt; \\appsrv\software\;\\appsrv\updates\;\\appsrv\taxlaw\ &lt;&lt; to computers of this OU.<br>
	To differentiate which users or groups of this computers may run applications from this directory i use the folder permissions i described above.<br>

	<H3>Example in a domain</H3>

	<p>
	Configure a folder path for a standard user to run applications with local administrator rights from this directory. <br>
	By this way you can share a folder in a domain for applications, scripts, updates, patches... <br>
	for limited users, which can install software themselves as they become available in this folder.<br>
	When required, the domain administrator must only copy the according application file to this folder and inform the user.<br>
	You can also specified a local program path, its applications you want to allow to start under administrator rights from a standard user account.
	</p>

	<p>
	Description:
	</p>

	 <ol>
		 <li>
		Use a local path or share a folder on a server in a	domain with read permissions for user and on a network share also for the machine account.<br>
		You can can also create a group of computers and/or users which are authorized to this folder. <br>
		By this way you can set flexible rights for users, computers or groups which may run applications over RunasRob with administrator rights<br>
		 <img alt="Server Share Permission" title="Server Share Permission" src="images/screenshots/ServerSharePermission.jpg"><br>
		 </li>
		 <li>
		 Install and configure RunasRob on client and set the authorized folders or applications in registry <br>
		by a) RunasAdmin.exe, b) central group policy or c) command line.<br>
		 <br>
		a) RunasAdmin<br>
		 <img alt="Screenshot RunasAdmin" src="images/screenshots/ScreenshotRunasAdmin.jpg"><br>
		 <br>
		b) Central group policy<br>
		 <img style="width: 862px; height: 419px;" alt="GroupPolicyAllowedPath" src="images/screenshots/GroupPolicyAllowedPath.jpg"><br>
		 <br>
		c) Command line <br>
		install RunasRob with option/install and /allowedpath, followed by the folder or application you want to allow. <br>
		If you want to allow more folders and applications separate it with a semicolon..<br>
		On example below you allow applications in local path taxlaw, the program regedt32.exe and applications in server path share1.<br>
		&gt;&gt; runasrob.exe /install /allowedpath:C:\Program Files (x86)\taxlaw\;C:\windows\system32\regedt32.exe;\\server\share1\; &lt;&lt; <br>
		 <img style="width: 877px; height: 114px;" alt="Runas Rob Install AllowedPath" title="Runas Rob Install AllowedPath" src="images/screenshots/RunasRobInstallAllowedPathCMD.jpg"><br>
		<br>
		An advanced optional switch are /asservice (by default) or /asadmin.<br>
		/asservice -&gt; The allowed application is running under system account with elevated admin rights.<br> 
		/asadmin -&gt; After the user enter his credentials he will be a member of the local administrator group for this application which is running under his own account.<br>
		&gt;&gt; runasrob.exe /install /allowedpath:C:\Program Files (x86)\taxlaw\;C:\windows\system32\regedt32.exe;\\server\share1\;/asadmin &lt;&lt; <br>
		 <img style="width: 877px; height: 114px;" alt="allowed folder with option asadmin" title="allowed folder with option asadmin" src="images/screenshots/RunasRobInstallAllowedPathCMDAsAdmin.jpg"><br>	 
		<br>
		 </li>
		 <li>
		Configuration is finished. Now you can see on registry path of RunasRob the Key allowedPath. <br>
		You can edit this key with Runasadmin, manually or central policies.<br>
		On 64 Bit machine &gt;&gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\RunasRob<br>
		On 32 Bit machine &gt;&gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RunasRob<br>
		<img style="width: 947px; height: 231px;" alt="RunasRob Registry Screenshot of Allowed Path" title="RunasRob Registry Screenshot of Allowed Path" src="images/screenshots/RunasRobRegistryAllowedPath.jpg"><br>
		<br>
		</li>
		 <li>
		 Now a user can call applications from this folders with local administrator rights <br>
		by drag and drop the allowed application over RunasRob.exe <br>
		or you make a shortcut or batch file like the following commands..<br> 
		&gt;&gt; runasrob.exe \\server\share1\yourProgram.exe &lt;&lt;<br>
		&gt;&gt; runasrob.exe c:\windows\system32\regedt32.exe &lt;&lt;<br>
		&gt;&gt; runasrob.exe c:\Program Files (x86)\taxlaw\update.exe &lt;&lt;<br>
		 <img style="width: 836px; height: 533px;" alt="Call an Application from an allowed path" title="Call an Application from an allowed path" src="images/screenshots/CallApplicationFromAnAllowedPath.jpg"><br>
