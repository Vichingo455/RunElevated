	RunAsRob is not just a Runas with password command utility, it offers four completely different login options to run software as administrator with system rights.
	</H2>
	
	<div itemprop="disambiguatingDescription">	
	<p>
	A limited user can temporarily moved to the local administrator group, only for the authorized application or <br>
	RunAsRob start the application with system account, this account has even more local privileges than an administrator.<br>
	A further variation is running as service, which launch the program after computer is booted and before a user logs in.<br>
	The fourth login option is running software as different user, like the command runas, but with the possibility to pass the password encrypted.
	</p>
	<p>
	Another advantage of RunAsRob is the possibility to authorize a complete folder from where you can start a program with administrator privileges. 
	</p>
	</div>

	<p>Spectrum of possibilities</p>
	 <ul>
	 <li>Authorize program files or folders, which can used from a limited user to run software as administrator.
	 </li>
	 <li>Distribute software, updates, patches, drivers,... by simply copying the update file on a network share you have authorized in RunAsRob and user can run it as admin from there.
	 </li>
	 <li>Give only a specific program administrator rights instead of a whole user account.
	 </li>
	 <li>Delegate administrative tasks to users by authorizing the specific job.
	 </li>
	 <li>Manage all allowed application files, folders and directories in a domain central by group policies, organisational units and ntfs folder rights. RunAsRob harmonised well with it.
	 </li>
	 <li>Bypass UAC for a script or an application.
	 </li>
	 <li>A script and a program can run as system account via RunAsRob, a system account has more system privileges than an administrator.
	 </li>
	 <li>Run application as admin with the own profile and setting of the limitied user account. <br>
	 In other runas utilities it is just possible to run as administrator by using another account.
	 </li>
	 <li>Wildcard asterisk * and environment variable like %windir% are possible to authorize a relative directory or program path.
	 </li>
	 <li>You need not credentials of an admin account in an encrypted file or elsewhere. <br>
	 The authorization and login information are controlled by registry, folder permissions and a system service.
	 </li>
	 <li>Run as service an application or a script with system privileges after system boot, if a user is logged in or not.
	 </li>
	 <li>RunAsRob can effective and easy used on a local client, in a small windows network or in a large domain environment, because its clearly designed.
	 </li>
