	Run application as different user to start program as administrator from a limited account like the command runas, but without to enter login information on each start.
	</H2>
	
	<div itemprop="disambiguatingDescription">
	<p>
	Run application under another account without entering the password is possible with the runas password utility RunAsSpc.<br>
	The application and account information can pass directly <br>
	or can be read out from an encrypted file, created on command line via runasspc.exe<br>
	or the graphical interface RunAsSpcAdmin.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>
	RunAsSpc needs no installation and is portable with all options
	</p>

	 <ul>
		<li>
		Software packages, drivers, updates, security patches can run as administrator and installed by a limited user <br>
		via an encrypted file from which the application run with administrator privileges. 
		</li>
		<li>
		Users often work under administrator account, because a program need administrator rights to run.<br>
		By using RunAsSpc, a limited user need no longer login as administrator to run these application.
		</li>
		<li>
		Run internet browser as administrator makes the system vulnerable to viruses, hacker attacks and other security risks. <br>
		Surfing with a limited account decreases the risk.<br>
		Use RunAsSpc and start the internet browser with a limited user account.
		</li>
		<li>
		Instruct a non admin user to confgure a client computer or do a specific administrator job<br> 
		without give him the admin account login information.<br>
		Send him an encrypted file with that job.
		</li>
		<li>
		Via RunAsSpc you can run a specific application as different user, <br>
		if you need the login to an application with two different accounts on the same desktop, <br>
		because you have to do some jobs with another account.<br>
		Maybe you represent your college for a while or you need other rights for a while inside the application for some tasks.

	 <H3>FAQ</H3>

	 <ul>
	 <li>
	 Run as administrator is not working. <br>
	Your application, script, or batch file probably don't request
	elevated privileges on an UAC activated system. <br>
	If an application request elevated privileges, then RunAsSpc start it with elevated privileges.<br>
	A non-elevated application, can run with administrator
	rights by using my tool <a href="https://robotronic.de/elevateen.html">RunElevated</a>
	combined with RunAsSpc,
	or simply using our advanced tool <a href="https://robotronic.de/runasroben.html">RunasRob</a>.
	 </li>
	 <li>
	 Bypass the UAC Dialog is possible with <a href="https://robotronic.de/runasroben.html">RunasRob</a>.
	 </li>
	 <li>
	 RunAsSpc couldn&rsquo;t find the application<br>
	- Set the complete path of the application in the encrypted file.<br>
	- The application must be reached for the user who calls the application over RunAsSpc, because RunAsSpc read the checksum of the
	application before the application will be call under another user context.
	</li>
	 <li>
	RunAsSpc is compatible with the most file endings like *.exe,*.msi,*.bat,*.cmd,*.wsh,*.vbs, *.msc...
	</li>
	 <li>
	 Unknown publisher message or Open File security warning dissapear <br>
	after you accept RunAsSpc as known application by uncheck the box:
	&gt;&gt; Always ask before opening this file &lt;&lt;
	</li>
	 <li>
	 Error messages can be suppressed by switch /quiet for example:<br>
	&gt;&gt; runasspc.exe /cryptfile:&ldquo;path/cryptfile.spc&ldquo; /quiet &lt;&lt;
	</li>
	 <li>
	 UNC Path are supported. Mapped drives not. <br>
	The encrypted file can be store on a mapped drive but not the application.
	</li>
	 <li>
	 RunAsSpc, cryptfile and the application can be store on different folders.
	</li>
	 <li>
	 Errors Codes returned by RunAsSpc:<br>
	Most errors codes are explained on MSDN:
	https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms681381.aspx
	</li>
	 <li>
	 RunAsSpc is Running on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Server 2008, Server 2012, Server 2016, Server 2019, 64 und 32 Bit versions</li>
	 <li>
	 Restriction in version for private use is the startup window with license information, which appears at random intervals.
	 </li>
	 <li>
	 Authorize only a specific user or group to run a an application. <br>
	This can be achieved by setting NTFS permissions to the encrypted file, the program file or program folder.<br>
	 </li>

	<li>
	Processes start from the allowed running application inherits the permissions. <br>
	This makes sense, but not in all cases. For example, if this application has a file open dialog to run other programs, a selected program launched from this dialog, run with same privileges. <br>
	</li>

	<li>
	Credentials are reversible encrypted that application can start with the account from the encrypted file. 
	</li>
	<li>
	To avoid that authorized application file can be renamed, set the option >> checksum. Application will be checked on bit level. <<
	</li>
